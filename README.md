Embed Privacy prevents loading of embedded external content and allows your site visitors to opt-in.

== Description ==

Content embedded from external sites such as YouTube or Twitter is loaded immediately when visitors access your site. Embed Privacy addresses this issue and prevents loading of these contents until the visitor decides to allow loading of external content.
But Embed Privacy not only protects your visitors privacy, but also makes your site load faster.

All embeds will be replaced by placeholders, ready for you to apply style as you wish. With only a couple of lines of CSS. 

By clicking on the placeholder the respective content will be reloaded.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/embed-privacy` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
1. Embedded content will automatically be replaced by a placeholder and can be loaded on demand by your visitors. There are no additional settings.
